# ixa-pipe-ned

This repository contains the Named Entity Disambiguation tool based on DBpedia Spotlight.
Providing that a DBpedia Spotlight Rest server for a given language is running, the ixa-pipe-ned module will take
KAF as input (containing <entities> elements) and perform Named Entity Disambiguation
for your language of choice.

Developed by IXA NLP Group (ixa.si.ehu.es) for the 7th Framework OpeNER European project.

    + src/ source files of ixa-pipe-ned
    + pom.xml modified pom.xml to install DBpedia Spotlight
    + README.md: This README

## Installation Procedure

In a snapshot:

 1. Modify ixa-pipe-ned/pom.xml as specified below.
 2. Compile ixa-pipe-ned module with mvn clean package
 3. Start Rest server as specified [here](https://github.com/ragerri/ixa-dbpedia-spotlight).
    cd dbpedia-spotlight/conf
    java -jar ../dist/target/dbpedia-spotlight-0.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar
 4. cat ner.kaf | ixa-pipe-ned/target/ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p $PORT_NUMBER

If you already have installed in your machine JDK7 and MAVEN 3, please go to step 3
directly. Otherwise, follow the detailed steps:

### 1. Install JDK 1.7

If you do not install JDK 1.7 in a default location, you will probably need to configure the PATH in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

    export JAVA_HOME=/yourpath/local/java17
    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}


If you use tcsh you will need to specify it in your .login as follows:

    setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java/java17
    setenv PATH ${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}


If you re-login into your shell and run the command

    java -version


You should now see that your jdk is 1.7

### 2. Install MAVEN 3

Download MAVEN 3 from

    wget http://ftp.udc.es/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz

Now you need to configure the PATH. For Bash Shell:

    export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ragerri/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
    export PATH=${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

For tcsh shell:

    setenv MAVEN3_HOME ~/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
    setenv PATH ${MAVEN3}/bin:{PATH}

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

    mvn -version


You should see reference to the MAVEN version you have just installed plus the JDK 7 that is using.

### 3. Download the repository

    git clone git@github.com:ragerri/ixa-pipe-ned.git

### 4. Modify pom.xml

Go to the the repository:

    cd ixa-pipe-ned/

And modify the properties element of the pom.xml to point to where the dbpedia-spotlight jar is placed
as setup by [following these instructions](https://github.com/ragerri/ixa-dbpedia-spotlight):

    <properties>
            <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
            <!--maven variable which points to your local spotlight -->
            <internal.path>/home/user/dbpedia-spotlight/dist/target/</internal.path>
          </properties>

For example, if you installed dbpedia-spotlight in `/home/user/dbpedia-spotlight`, the binary
dbpedia-spotlight-0.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar directory will correspond to `/home/user/dbpedia-spotlight/dist/target/` as
specified in the <properties> element above.

### 5. Install ixa-pipe-ned

Once this path is correctly set, install the ixa-pipe-ned module

    mvn clean package

This command will create a `ixa-pipe-ned/target` directory containing the
ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar binary with all dependencies included.

### 6. ixa-pipe-ned USAGE

The ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar requires a KAF document containing <entities> elements as standard input and
provides Named Entity Disambiguation as standard output. It also requires the port number as argument.
The port numbers assigned to each language are the following:

    - de: 2010
    - en: 2020
    - es: 2030
    - fr: 2040
    - it: 2050
    - nl: 2060

If you wanted to change the port numbers, please do so at the corresponding server_$lang.properties
in the [ixa-dbpedia-spotlight](https://github.com/ragerri/ixa-dbpedia-spotlight) repository. Note that
you will also need to change the corresponding server_$lang.properties in `dbpedia-spotlight/conf/` directory.

**Once you have a [DBpedia Spotlight Rest server running](https://github.com/ragerri/ixa-dbpedia-spotlight)** you
can send queries to it via the ixa-pipe-ned module as follows:

    cat ner.kaf | java -jar ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p $PORT_NUMBER
